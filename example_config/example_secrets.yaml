# Add a random secret to `jwt_secret`, and uncomment.. This secret is used to sign and verify authenticated
# user JWTs, which are stored as cookies in the user's browser. If you do not provide a jwt_secret,
# one will be randomly generated by each ConsoleMe instance.
# If you are load balancing requests between multiple ConsoleMe instances,
# the user will fail authentication when their request hits an instance other than the one that generated their
# auth cookie.
