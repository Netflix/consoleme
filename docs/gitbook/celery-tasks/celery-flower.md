# Celery Flower

[Celery Flower](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a web-based tool that allows us to monitor our celery tasks and workers to determine which are succeeding, which are failing, to view tracebacks associated with failing jobs, and to adjust settings such as concurrency and autoscaling. We recommend setting this up alongside your Celery deployment.
