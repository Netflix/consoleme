# Add or Update Dependencies 

To know about the required dependencies, their minimum required versions check the requirements*.txt files.
Whenever we pin to a specific version in requirements*.in, we add a comment explaining why we are doing so. 
We also have comments on their use.


All the required dependencies for running the commands on this page are in pip-tools (https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) which installs pip-compile command.  

## To install or update all dependencies

**Note** : The pip-compile command lets you compile a requirements*.txt from your dependencies, specified in either setup.py or requirements.in.
So, ensure you donâ€™t have requirements*.txt if you compile setup.py or requirements*.in from scratch, otherwise, it might interfere.
You can also specify a file name other than requirements.txt in the following command. 

To compile all dependencies run
```text
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt requirements.in
```

To update all dependencies, periodically re-run
```text
@echo "--> Updating Python requirements"
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip-tools
pip install --upgrade setuptools
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt requirements.in -U --no-emit-index-url
pip-compile --output-file requirements-test.txt requirements-test.in requirements.txt -U --no-emit-index-url
pip-compile --output-file requirements-docs.txt requirements-docs.in -U --no-emit-index-url
@echo "--> Done updating Python requirements"
@echo "--> Installing new dependencies"
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
@echo "--> Done installing new dependencies"
```

## To add a specific new dependency

To compile a specific dependency run 
```text
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt requirements.in [package_name] --no-emit-index-url
```
Replace [package_name] with the dependency name you want from requirements.txt file.

Whenever we pin to a specific version in requirements*.in, we add a comment explaining why we are doing so.
You can also specify the version you want to compile by running. 
```text
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt [package_name]==[package_version] --no-emit-index-url
```
Example of bcrypt package
```text
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt bcrypt==3.2.0 --no-emit-index-url
```

## To update a specific dependency

**Note** : Make sure you check the requirements*.in file comments before you change the version. 

To update a specific package to the latest version use the --upgrade-package or -P flag:
```text
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt --upgrade-package [package_name]  
```
Replace [package_name] with the dependency name you want from requirements.txt file.

Whenever we pin to a specific version in requirements*.in, we add a comment explaining why we are doing so.
You can also specify the version you want to upgrade to by running. 
```text
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt --upgrade-package [package_name]==[package_version] 
```
Example of bcrypt package
```text
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt --upgrade-package bcrypt==3.2.0 
```

You can combine --upgrade and --upgrade-package in one command, to provide constraints on the allowed upgrades. 
For example to upgrade all packages whilst constraining bcrypt to the latest version less than 3.0:

```text
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt --upgrade --upgrade-package 'bcrypt<3.0'
```
