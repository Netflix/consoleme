# AWS Credentials in the CLI using Weep and ConsoleMe

Weep is a CLI utility for getting AWS credentials from ConsoleMe, serving them to your AWS CLI or SDKs, and \(in many case\) caching/refreshing credentials automatically.

Read about the specifics in our [Getting Started with Weep](cli.md) guide.

Weep supports the following operations:

1\) **Emulating the ECS Credential Provider locally**. \(This provides a convenient way to get credentials on-demand, without needing networking rules. Each of your shells or IDEs can use a different role. Weep will cache these credentials and refresh them on demand\):

2\) **Emulating the EC2 Instance Metadata Service locally**:

3\) **Invoking weep using the** [**credential\_process flow**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html)**.** \(Note: We've seen this introduce performance issues for a large number of roles.\)

4\) **Exporting credentials as environment variables**

5\) **Exporting credentials to your ~/.aws/credentials file**

6\) **Have weep perform nested assume-role calls on your behalf, and serve the assumed role credentials** \(The video below shows this flow for Weep's ECS credential provider mode. You can do this with most other modes as well\):
